## Exploring Computer Science Unit 2 - Problem Solving

This unit provides students with opportunities to become “computational thinkers” by applying a variety of problem-solving techniques as they create solutions to problems that are situated in a variety of contexts. The range of contexts motivates the need for students to think abstractly and apply known algorithms where appropriate, but also create new algorithms. Analysis of various solutions and algorithms will highlight problems that are not easily solved by computer and for which there are no known solutions. This unit also focuses on the connections between mathematics and computer science. Students will be introduced to selected topics in discrete mathematics including Boolean logic, functions, graphs and the binary number system. Students are also introduced to searching and sorting algorithms and graphs.

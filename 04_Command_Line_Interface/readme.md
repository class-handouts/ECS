## Exploring Computer Science Unit 4 - Command Line Interface

This unit provides students with opportunities to become proficient with the basics of the command line interface (CLI). The CLI is a text-based application for viewing, handling, and manipulating files on your computer. It's much like Windows Explorer or Finder on the Mac, but without the graphical user interface (GUI). Other names for the command line are prompt, console or terminal. We will be using the Linux CLI which is "identical" to the Mac Terminal and close to the Windows Command Prompt. The topics in this unit include: navigating the files system as well as creating and removing files and folders.
